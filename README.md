# Project Setup Instructions

This project utilizes Python and requires specific packages to be installed. Below are instructions on setting up the project on both Windows and Ubuntu using `virtualenv`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

## Windows Setup

1. Open a command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd path\to\your\project
```

3. Create a virtual environment.
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
4. Activate the virtual environment.
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

5. Install project dependencies.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Ubuntu Setup
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```
3. Create a virtual environment.
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
4. Activate the virtual environment.
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
5. Install project dependencies.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the Project
Once the virtual environment is activated, you can run your Python scripts as usual. For example, if your main script is main.py:

```bash
python main.py
```
Notes
Make sure to replace path\to\your\project and path/to/your/project with the actual path to your project directory.
If you encounter issues, ensure that Python and pip are correctly installed and added to the system PATH.

Please note that the instructions assume the use of the `virtualenv` tool for creating virtual environments. If it's not installed, you can install it using `pip install virtualenv`.
